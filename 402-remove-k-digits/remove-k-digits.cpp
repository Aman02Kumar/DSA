    //handling edge case 3 -> if we have a incremental string then no pop occurs as every num[i] > s.top() -> so we might end up adding all elements to stack and k didn't decrease at all, or we might removed some elements but k still isn't zero that means we reached incremental string state midway and some part of the string is incremental rather entire string being incremental -> so we handle this case by simply popping the stack equal to remaining k.

    //handling 2nd edge cases -> to eliminate leading zeros, we check if the back which is effectively the start of our answer is zero or not and unti result is not empty and string starts with zero, we keep removing it, as soon as all starting zeros are removed or string gets empty the result contains the answer in reverse order

    while( !result.empty() && result.back() == '0'){
        result.pop_back();
